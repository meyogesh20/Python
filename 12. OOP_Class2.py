# ðŸ”¹ Instance Variables vs Class Variables in Python
'''
âœ… Instance Variables
    1. These are unique to each object (instance) of a class.
    2. Each time you create a new object, it gets its own separate copy of these variables.
    3. Changing one doesn't affect the other.

âœ… Class Variables
    1. These are shared across all instances of the class.
    2. There is only one copy, and all objects refer to the same value unless overridden.
    3. But if you override it in one object, the new value will be available for that one object only.
    4. Remaining all objects will have the same value of Class Variable
